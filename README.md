# WCFRest

A WCF Test REST API from 2014

In `original` branch you will find the original source code for this application. In `master` an upgraded, refactored version.

## Description 

A simple example about how you can build a rest api with WCF. Since several years ago WebAPI is the .NET default option to create a REST api but at that time, even when WebAPI RTM was released in 2012, a client insisted to create a REST api based on WCF.
